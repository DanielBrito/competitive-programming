# Competitive Programming

I think competitive programming is an awesome opportunity for those who want to improve their skills because it pushes us to think creatively, and helps us to put into practice that math knowledge we thought we'd never use in order to solve real-world problems.

These are my solutions to some challenges from several programming platforms, contests, and interviews.

I try really hard to find the most efficient solution, but - unfortunately - sometimes I just really can't (and appeal to brute force), because I'm still learning the power of each data structure, technique, language, and paradigm (and I'll always be). However, after some research, I always end up discovering awesome articles and [inspiring codes](https://github.com/DanielBrito/programming-problems/tree/master/Inspiring%20Codes) which improve my programming skills.

When I feel really inspired, I try to document these codes (exploring time and space complexity) to facilitate the understanding of what I'm doing.
