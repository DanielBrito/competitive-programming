# Programming problems

Solved problems from several programming platforms and contests.

I try really hard to find the most efficient solution, but sometimes I just really can't, because I'm still learning the power of each language and paradigm (and I'll always be). But fortunately, after some research, I always end up discovering awesome articles and [inspiring codes](https://github.com/DanielBrito/programming-problems/tree/master/Inspiring%20Codes) which improve my programming skills.
